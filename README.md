Sure, here's a basic `README.md` file for your project:

```markdown
# CelebFace Machine Learning Project

This project uses the CelebA dataset to train a machine learning model to predict facial attributes from images.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**: Use git to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Python packages**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, use pip to install the necessary Python packages. It's recommended to do this in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.

   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: If you're using Windows, the command to activate the virtual environment is `env\Scripts\activate`.

3. **Download the dataset**: Run the `setup_dataset.sh` script to download and extract the CelebA dataset. You'll need to have the Kaggle API set up on your machine to do this.

   ```
   chmod +x setup_dataset.sh
   ./setup_dataset.sh
   ```

## Usage

Once you've set up the project, you can train the model by running the `train_model.py` script:

```
python train_model.py
```

This will start training the model. Note that this can take a long time and use a lot of resources, so make sure your machine is up to the task. The script uses early stopping, so it will stop training once it determines that the model isn't improving anymore.
